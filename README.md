# Face-Recognition-with-keras
Here you can work on one class or many classes. A class of persons who do not have access and are not identified and a series of classes of persons who have access and are identified. In this example, two classes have been worked on.

## Datasets
The data is from certain people and myself. You can download kaggle data from the link below or work on your own data.

### Requirements
Running `Face-Recognition` requires:
* Python 3.8 (tested under Python 3.10.4)
* numpy 1.22.3
* tensorflow 2.9.1
* keras 2.9.0
* cv2 4.6.0
* matplotlib 3.5.1

### Installation
In order to test the script please run the following commands:
```sh
# install numpy
pip install numpy
# install keras
pip install keras
# install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow
# install cv2
pip install opencv-python
```

### Description of the library
A summary of explanations about libraries:
* The `cv2` helps to read and working with image.
* The `numpy` it makes it easy to do math and work with matrices.
* The `tensorflow vs keras` Python  library helps to use Multiplying the weights in the matrix and artificial intelligence algorithms.
